ConversAI
Welcome to ConversAI! This project leverages speech recognition and GPT-3.5 to create an interactive conversational interface where users can speak to the system, receive intelligent responses, and have the text converted to speech. It's designed to provide a seamless and natural communication experience.

Features
Speech Recognition: Speak to the system and have your speech recognized and transcribed.
GPT-3.5 Integration: Interact with OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model to get intelligent and context-aware responses.
Text-to-Speech: Responses from the AI are converted back to speech, creating a fluid conversational loop.
Continuous Listening: The system can continuously listen for input until you choose to send your message.
Technologies Used
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Material-UI: A popular React UI framework.
Axios: Promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js.
SpeechRecognition API: Web API for recognizing speech input.
SpeechSynthesis API: Web API for converting text to speech.
OpenAI GPT-3.5: A state-of-the-art language model developed by OpenAI.
